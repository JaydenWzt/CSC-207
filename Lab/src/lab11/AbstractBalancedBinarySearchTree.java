/**
 * An abstract balanced binary search tree.
 * This defines the common underlying methods of a balanced binary search tree.
 * In order to facilitate this, we also have a generic parameter for the node type to enable nodes to store any necessary information within them.
 * Duplicates are not permitted in the tree, but null is allowed if the {@code Comparator} used to compare {@code T} types permits it.
 * Note that the {@code Comparator} is assumed to return 0 only if items are equal, not merely equivalent.
 * <br><br>
 * To specify precisely the behavior of this tree, the key functions not override are {@code AddN}, {@code RemoveN}, and {@code Contains}.
 * The former two methods are protected and add/remove a node from the tree, which {@code Add} and {@code Remove} use to return a boolean.
 * There is no need to override either {@code Add} or {@code Remove} because of this except in niche use cases.
 * <br><br>
 * We give the default implementations of {@code AddN}, {@code RemoveN}, and {@code Contains} below.
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		{@code AddN}: Adds the new element so that at every node, all elements of the node's left subtree are smaller than it and all elements of its right subtree are larger than it.
 * 		After this, if the add succeeded, it calls the {@code BalaceAdd} method on the added node to rebalance the tree.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		{@code RemoveN}: Removes an element from the tree while maintaining the ordering specified in {@code Add}.
 * 		After this, if the remove succeeded, it calls the {@code BalanceRemove} method on the removed node to rebalance the tree.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>{@code Contains}: Takes advantage of the ordering to search efficiently for an element.</li>
 * </ul>
